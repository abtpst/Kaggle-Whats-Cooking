Python's GridSearchCV is a very useful package for building and training machine learning models. We will use this packge to

> - Build a pipeline consisting of a feature selector and a classifier.
> - Provide a set of options/parameters for the pipeline's constituents.
> - Store the best set of parameters that GridSearchCV comes up with.
> - Use the optimal parameters in the above step to build an optimal pipeline for predictions.

### Build and train

Please look at the well documented cookTrain.py

### Predict

Please look at the well documented cookPredict.py
